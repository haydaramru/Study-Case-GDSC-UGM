## Introduction

In this case study, we aim to replicate the functionality of posting and managing tweets on the X platform. The API allows users to perform the following operations:

- **Create:** Post a new tweet with text, a URL, hashtags, a "via" source, and related content.
- **Read:** Retrieve tweets by their unique IDs or search for tweets using specific criteria.
- **Update:** Edit the content of an existing tweet.
- **Delete:** Remove a tweet from the platform.

This case study leverages the reference parameters provided by [X's developer documentation](https://developer.x.com/) to maintain consistency with the platform's standards.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

- `POST /v1/posts`: Create a new tweet.
- `GET /v1/posts`: Retrieve all tweets.
- `GET /v1/posts/:id`: Retrieve a tweet by its unique ID.
- `PUT /v1/posts/:id`: Update an existing tweet.
- `DELETE /v1/posts/:id`: Delete a tweet.

## Parameters

### Post (Tweet) Content Parameters

1. `text` (string): The main content of the tweet.
2. `url` (string): A URL or link associated with the tweet.
3. `hashtags` (array of strings): An array of hashtags used in the tweet.
4. `via` (string): The source or platform from which the tweet is posted.
5. `related` (array of strings): An array of related content or users.
